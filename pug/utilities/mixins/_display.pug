mixin displayProperty
  p Display utility classes that apply to all breakpoints, from 
    code xs 
    | to 
    code xl
    | , have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from 
    code min-width: 0; 
    | and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.

  p.mt-3 As such, the classes are named using the format:

  ul
    li
      code .d-{value} 
      |  for 
      code xs
    li 
      code .d-{breakpoint}-{value}
      |  for
      code  sm
      | ,
      code  md
      | ,
      code  lg
      | , and 
      code  xl
      | ,
  p.mt-3 Where value is one of:

  ul 
    li
      code none
    li
      code inline
    li
      code inline-block
    li
      code block
    li
      code table
    li
      code table-cell
    li
      code table-row
    li
      code flex
    li
      code inline-flex

  p The display values can be altered by changing the 
    code $displays 
    | variable and recompiling the SCSS.
  p The media queries effect screen widths with the given breakpoint or larger. For example, 
    code .d-lg-none 
    | sets 
    code display: none; 
    | on both 
    code lg 
    | and 
    code xl 
    | screens.


mixin displayInHide
  p For faster mobile-friendly development, use responsive display classes for showing and hiding elements by device. Avoid creating entirely different versions of the same site, instead hide elements responsively for each screen size.

  p To hide elements simply use the 
    code .d-none 
    | class or one of the 
    code .d-{sm,md,lg,xl}-none 
    | classes for any responsive screen variation.

  p To show an element only on a given interval of screen sizes you can combine one 
    code .d-*-none class with a 
    code .d-*-* class, for example 
    code .d-none .d-md-block .d-xl-none 
    | will hide the element for all screen sizes except on medium and large devices.
